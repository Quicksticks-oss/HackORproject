# Project CryptOR
Project CryptOR is an application that helps people learn about how blockchain technology works with interactive guides, demos, and simulations.

# Getting Started
First clone the repository. Then navigate to frontend > out > CryptOR-win32-x64 > CryptOR.exe. This is the desktop application and can be extracted from nest of files. The desktop app will show how to set up the simulated python blockchain.

Have fun!
